# What

Tennis balls are pressurized to about 28 psi absolute, making them bouncy and nice to hit. Since atmospheric pressure is around 14 psi, balls gradually lose pressure over time, reducing their bounce. To preserve their freshness, balls can be stored in a pressurized container that matches their internal pressure. While tennis ball pressurizers exist, most require external pumps and arenâ€™t very user-friendly. Few high-quality option exists, however only in Europe. They're also very expensive and not always in stock, so I want to design and engineer my own pressurizer(for cheaper too).
